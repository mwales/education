How to Add States:
- Go to Transition properties editting window by clicking on "Edit
  Transitions..." on the Edit menu.
- Select "Add a New State..." from the States menu.
- Enter a name for the state and click OK.
- Locate a valid image file to represent the state.  Valid image files are
  20 x 20 images in .jpg, .gif, .bmp, and .tif formats.

Editting Transition Rules:
- Always have a set of rules that will insure that there are never any cells
  that are empty.
- You cannot delete the last state on the list.

Transition Rules:
- Movement:  Will cause cells to move in different directions each clock
  cycle.  The direction is any multiple of 90 degrees.  0 degrees is for
  movement right.  Set trails to 1 if you want moving cells to leave a trail
  behind them.  Set trails to 0 if you do not want a trail.
- Random:  This causes a state to randomly appear anywhere on the map.  The
  percentage should be from 0-100, and corresponds to the percent chance that
  any given cell will transition to this state.  Set trails to 1 if you do
  not want the states to disappear, and 0 if they should disappear on the
  next clock cycle.
- Evolution:  Allows a state to check it's neighbors for a certain state and
  react (evolve) based on that.  It checks the surrounding four neighbors for
  the state number given in the parameter.  If it finds atleast x amount of
  those states around it (or other states like itself), the cell will
  transition to the state that the rule belongs to.
- Game of Life:  Allows the user to simulate John Conway's game of life.
  Both states in the game must have this rule selected.  The state number
  for each parameter in both rules should be the same.  The state number is 0
  for the top state in the list, and increases as you go down the list.
- Firelike:  Used to simulate fire.  The burnout rate is the percent chance
  any cell of fire will happen to burn out (0-100).  The lowest state to burn
  is the state number of the state that is lowest on the list and is still
  combustible.  Anything between fire and that state on the list can burn.

How to Edit Initial States:
- First, you must have created atleast one state for the simulation.
- Select New on the file menu of the main simulation window.
- Input a map size and click OK.  Maximum map size is 45 x 35.
- When blank map loads, simply click the button of the state you would like
  to place and click which areas you want filled by that state.

How to Load and Save Simulations:
- To save a simulation, click "Save..." from the file menu.  You must have
  some states created and a map in the simulation to save the simulation.
- To load a simulation, click "Load..." from the file menu.  Simulations
  stored can only be loaded by the program when it is running in that save
  version of the JRE.  You cannot save a simulation in JRE 1.2.2 and load it
  in JRE 1.3.

To run simulations:
- Simply click on Play on the main screen.  Press stop anytime to reset the
  counter and stop the simulation.
