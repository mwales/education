# ChibiAkumas

ChibiAkumas is an online tutorial and set of youtube videos that teach how to
program retro consoles / computers, with assembly instruction tutorials as well.

These tutorials are targeted for Windows users.  And while most of the tools can
be installed on Linux, ChibiAkumas doesn't really show how to set the tools up
on Linux.

So that is what this repo is, the tutorials of his that I tried, and changed up
a small bit to make them work with my Ubuntu 22.04 installation.
